I've been pulling some information about how the HHA scores things in ACNL. Here are my findings:

* Items that can be purchased from the Nooks: 151 points
* - > This includes walls and floors 
* Items that are purchased from Gracie: 251 points
* Spotlight items and the lucky clover: 351
* Items from events: 451

The Feng Shui hypothesis seems to hold, and certain items appear to have more point values if placed in the correct areas. Specifically:
* Lucky Clover +600 when placed in the green area
